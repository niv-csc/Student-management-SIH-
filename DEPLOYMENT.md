# Deployment Instructions

This document provides instructions on how to deploy this Next.js application.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/niv-csc/Student-management-SIH-.git
   cd Student-management-SIH-
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Application Locally

To run the application in a development environment, use the following command:
```bash
npm run dev
```
This will start the development server, typically at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Building for Production

To create a production-ready build of the application, run:
```bash
npm run build
```
This command compiles and optimizes the application for production. The output will be in the `.next` directory.

## Starting the Production Server

After building the application, you can start the production server with:
```bash
npm run start
```
This will serve the optimized application, typically at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Deployment Platforms

This Next.js application can be deployed to any platform that supports Node.js. Here are a few popular options:

### Vercel

[Vercel](https://vercel.com/) is the recommended platform for deploying Next.js applications, as it is created by the same team.

1. **Push your code to a Git repository** (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
2. **Import your project into Vercel.**
3. **Vercel will automatically detect that it is a Next.js application and configure the build settings.**
4. **Deploy.**

### Netlify

[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) is another excellent option for deploying Next.js applications.

1. **Push your code to a Git repository.**
2. **Create a new site from Git on Netlify.**
3. **Netlify will detect the Next.js framework and set up the build commands.**
4. **Deploy.**

### Other Platforms (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure)

You can also deploy this application to any cloud provider that supports Node.js. You will need to set up a server, install Node.js, and configure it to run the `npm run start` command.

## Environment Variables

If your application requires environment variables (e.g., for API keys), create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.example.com
```
Ensure you configure these variables in your deployment platform's settings.
